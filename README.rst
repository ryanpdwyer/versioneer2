An updated, simplified version of versioneer.

Development Note
----------------

Since this project uses itself for versioning, when you make a change to the main stript
 (versioneer2/__init__.py), you should then run the following commands::

    python setup.py install
    versioneer2installer
    python setup.py versioneer


Then your changes have actually updated both __init__.py and the bundled copy of versioneer. To see the effect of all of your changes, run setup.py install again and test normally.
